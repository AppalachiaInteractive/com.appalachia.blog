Appalachia Interactive has big plans in a lot of areas - in how we [help](https://appalachiainteractive.com/causes) those that we can, in what we want to achieve with [Keepers of Creation](https://keepersofcreation.com), and more.  But we also have big plans in being meaningful contributors to the Unity3D open source scene.

We're going to be publishing open-source as much of our game's code as we legally can.  Some of the components we're using are closed-source, and some we don't have a license to redistribute - but our own code (and art and designs and just about everything else) will be open source.

There will be a few ways to get at it.
