Hello from Chris and Janice!  We're finally launching the Appalachia Interactive site, along with this blog.  Stay tuned as we document both the growth of our studio, as well as the development of [Keepers Of Creation](https://keepersofcreation.com).

## Keepers Of Creation

Keepers Of Creation is an immersive single-player exploration-survival experience set in the ancient and mysterious forests of Appalachia.

Alone in the woods, players are invited to explore the old-growth rocky pine forests, jagged shale barrens, and lush cove forests while being challenged to survive using the strategies of those who lived there, and to learn to live in a land with a mind of its own.

Designed with a meticulous attention to detail, complex simulations of human, animal, and natural dynamics are woven together into a rich and layered world where you are enveloped by a beautiful and fascinating environment that breathes with life.  

Make your own story as you survive among dozens of animal species and hundreds of fruits, plants, and mushrooms.  Players seeking a relaxing experience can peacefully wander, swim, or paddle through the mesmerizing soundscape and beautiful geography of the land.  Ambitious players will track animals by footprint and trail signs, forage for wild fruit, crops, and mushrooms, and craft everything they need to survive from the land's abundant resources.  Those looking for a challenge can venture into the territories better left to the true apex predators of the land - bears, cougars, wolves, and others.

And when you're there, if you listen close, you might hear the whispers on the wind that quietly tell of things in forest that are older than the trees.

More to come!
