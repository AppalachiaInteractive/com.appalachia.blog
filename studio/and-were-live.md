Hello from Chris and Janice!  We're finally launching the Appalachia Interactive site, along with this blog.  Stay tuned as we document both the growth of our studio, as well as the development of [Keepers Of Creation](https://keepersofcreation.com).

## Keepers Of Creation

Keepers Of Creation is an immersive single-player exploration-survival experience set in the ancient, mysterious forests of Appalachia.  Alone in the woods, players are invited to explore the old-growth rocky pine forests, jagged shale barrens, and lush cove forests while being challenged to discover the survival strategies of those who lived there, and to learn to live in a land with a mind of its own.  Designed with a meticulous attention to detail, ambitious players will track animals by footprint and trail signs, forage for wild fruit, crops, and mushrooms, and craft everything they need to survive from the land's abundant resources.  Players seeking a relaxing experience can peacefully wander, swim, or paddle through the mesmerizing soundscape and beautiful geography of the land.  And if players listen close enough, they may even hear whispers on the wind that softly speak of things in forest older than the trees.

More to come!
